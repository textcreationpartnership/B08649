            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The CASE of the</hi> BOROUGH <hi>of</hi> MARLBROUGH <hi>in the County of</hi> WILTS, <hi>concerning the Election of Sir</hi> JAMES HAYES K<hi rend="sup">nt.</hi> 
               <hi>and</hi> JOHN WILDMAN Eſq; <hi>to be</hi> Burgeſſes <hi>for this preſent</hi> Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679. the People of the Town being duly Aſſembled, they cryed up the Names of Sir JAMES HAYES, and Mr. WILDMAN; Then Silence being commanded, the then <hi>Mayor</hi> demanded particularly of each of thoſe <hi>Burgeſses</hi> who are ſworn to the <hi>Mayor,</hi> in reference to the Corporation, [which are about 35. in number,] for whom they were; And there was named amongſt them the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Bruce, Mr. Daniel, Mr. Bennet,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Wildman:</hi> Thereupon the great number of the Burgeſſes, lowdly cryed out for HAYES and WILDMAN, and demanded the Poll.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Mayor</hi> forthwith departed from the place of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, leaving the Body of the Town there, without any Officer, ſave the Conſtables; who by the Peoples deſire, immediately took the Poll of the greateſt part of the Electors, being Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, paying <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and about 150, (more being needleſs,) Signed and Sealed an <hi>Indenture,</hi> ſhewing the Election of Sir <hi>James Hayes,</hi> and <hi>Mr. VVildman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then three Proclamations being made, <hi>Sir James Hayes</hi> and <hi>Mr. Wildman</hi> were proclaimed Burgeſſes for that <hi>Borough</hi> for this Parliament: And the <hi>Indenture</hi> was then offer'd to the then <hi>Mayor,</hi> but he Peremptorily refus'd to Seal and Return it; But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the <hi>Lord Bruce,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bennet</hi> Eſq; upon pretence they had the Votes of the <hi>major part</hi> of the aforeſaid ſworn Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>The only Queſtion is, <hi>Whether all the</hi> Houſholders <hi>paying Scot</hi> and <hi>Lot in the</hi> Borough, <hi>are the true</hi> Burgeſſes <hi>of the</hi> Borough, <hi>and of Common</hi> Right <hi>to</hi> Elect; <hi>or ſuch only to whom the Mayors of the</hi> Corporations, <hi>have given an</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> obedience, <hi>that have no</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <hi>to the</hi> liberties <hi>of the Borough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis agreed, that the whole Borough, and Town, and all its Houſholders were expreſsly Incorporated by Charter in the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and thereby made one Community, or one Body of Burgeſſes, by the name of the <hi>Mayor and Burgeſſes of Marlbrough,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:187822:3"/>without Diſtinction, or Difference of the Burgeſſes or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by Names, Powers, or Priviledges, ſaving that of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> who is enabled Yearly to name <hi>two</hi> Burgeſſes to be Juſtice of the Peace; Yet by the Communities conſent, Orders may be made for the better Government of the Corporation, but ſuch Orders never did, nor can reſtrain or alter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right of all the Burgeſſes, or Inhabitants to chooſe for the Parliament; Nor any other of the Boroughs ancient Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Charters of the Town did never make any Aldermen, Capital, or chief Burgeſſes, or any Selected Body, or number of Burgeſſes under any ſtile or name whatſoever; Therefore there never hath been any ſelected, reſtrained or definite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Burgeſſes in the Town, but thoſe Houſholders that have been ſworn to the <hi>Mayor</hi> as aforeſaid, have been ſometimes a greater, and ſometimes a ſmaller number, and do acquire no Borough Rights by their Oath, all the Houſholders having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways injoyed equally all the Exemptions, Liberties and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages belonging to the Borough.</p>
            <p>However the Corporation of <hi>Marlbrough</hi> hath no Right to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament; nor did it ever pretend to have any ſuch Grant. It is the Antient Borough of <hi>Marlbrough,</hi> [where a Parliament that confirmed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> was held above 400. years ſince,] that hath the Right of ſending Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to Parliament by Preſcription; And all its Burgeſſes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> are by Common Right the Electors, whoſe Right cannot be deſtroy'd, or alter'd, by any Incorporation or Charter; Neither can the Burgeſſes or Inhabitants ſurrender their Right, or Forfeit it, or loſe it by Non-uſage, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, unleſs an Act of Parliament ſhould Disfranchize them, and take it away; many Parliaments have ſo reſolved in many caſes, where ſome whole Boroughs, and the Inhabitants of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Boroughs had not uſed their Rights for 200. years.</p>
            <p>This ancient right of the Burgeſles, is ſo diſtinct from any Priviledge granted to them by their Charters of Incorporation, that thoſe Priviledges may be forfeited or loſt, and the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it ſelf be extinct, or deſtroyed; Yet nevertheleſs this right would remain untoutcht in the Inhabitants or Burgeſſes of the Borough.</p>
            <p>So it was lately at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> when their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was deſtroyed, upon a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought againſt them, yet they choſe Burgeſſes for the Parliament by their Right of being an ancient Borough; So it is at old <hi>Sarum,</hi> and in many Boroughs which are not Corporations.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:187822:3"/>
            <p> The Burgeſſes of the Borough of <hi>Marlbrough,</hi> ſent their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to Parliament many Hundred years before they had a Mayor. And all the Houſholders of <hi>Marlbrough</hi> have enjoyed for near 500 years, many Exemptions, Liberties, Profits, of Common, and Priviledges, under the name of Burgeſſes of <hi>Malrbrough,</hi> which is conceived to be a clear and ſufficient conſtruction of the name of Burgeſſes; and if this Right of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Parliament Burgeſſes ſhould be taken from them, they muſt be Disfranchized, as having no Right to the Profits, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Priviledges, ſo long injoyed by them and their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</p>
            <p>The great pretence of the preſent Sworn Burgeſſes, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the other Burgeſſes from Electing, (who are five times more conſiderable then themſelves,) becauſe they are not Sworn Whereas it is evident, that the Inhabitants of Ancient Boroughs always were, and are Burgeſſes, without taking any Oath. And all the Inhabitants of <hi>Marlbrough,</hi> are alſo made Burgeſſes of the Corporation by Charter, without mention of any Oath, or granting any Authority to the <hi>Mayor,</hi> to give an Oath to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Their other pretenſion is, that by Ancient Uſage, the Sworn Burgeſſes only of the Corporation, have Elected. Whereas, the Election belongs not to the Members of the Corporation, (as ſuch) and the beginning of the Corporation it ſelf, is far from being Ancient. And they do not, nor can alledge, that it was ever reſolved by Parliament, or otherwiſe, that the Burgeſſes of the Borough have loſt their Original Ancient Rights; or that they ought not to Elect, or that they were ever actually exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Election.</p>
            <p>If it can be truly ſaid, that they have many times ſuffered the Sworn Burgeſſes of the Corporation to Elect without them, yet their neglect of uſing their own right could not deſtroy it, much leſs veſt it in the other; They and their Fathers might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the uſe of their Right for many years, and uſe it again law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully when they pleaſed; Yet in thoſe five lawful Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, which is all that have been for theſe 50 years paſt; In the Election of three of them, the Burgeſſes of the Borongh not Sworn, have interpoſed to give their Voices, and the Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and declared for by them, have been Choſen in two of them, without Conteſt, or Poll, and in the laſt Election, the Poll was refuſed them, when lawfully demanded.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Borough, with thoſe they have Choſen, flie to the Parliament for Relief.</p>
